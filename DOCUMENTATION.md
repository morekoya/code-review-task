# Documentation of the changes made

In the refactoring of this code, the first thing I noticed was the fact that there was no protected module. The protected module keeps methods from being mistakenly called. So, the first thing I did was to add the protected module. I also noticed that the articleParams method was improperly named so I renamed it article_params everywhere it was called.

Next, I noticed that the index method was too long. I resolved to take out `articles_type`, `boundary_limit` and `boundary_offset`. The boundary_limit and boundary_offset was also used in the feed method so I took out the similar lines contained therein, and I moved the methods to the protected section. I also removed the arrow from the code in the create method. 

Finally, I simplified the long line in the show and destroy methods. They had similar lines so I merely took them out to form a `not_owned` method.
